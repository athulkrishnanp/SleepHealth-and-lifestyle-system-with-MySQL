The Sleep Health & Disorder Prediction System is a machine-learning application that predicts whether an individual is healthy (no disorder) or suffers from Sleep Apnea or Insomnia based on their lifestyle and health habits. The system uses a Random Forest Classifier, trained on features such as sleep duration, physical activity level, stress, BMI, heart rate, caffeine consumption, and daily routine patterns.

Overview

This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a person has: -No Sleep Disorder -Sleep Apnea -Insomnia -The prediction is based on lifestyle and health-related features such as sleep duration, physical activity, stress level, BMI, heart rate, caffeine intake, and work routine. The goal is to build an intelligent system that identifies sleep-related disorders early and provides insights for better health.
